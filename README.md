# Conways-Game-Of-Life
Implemented conways game of life in C, C++. Used a server provided by the professor to send web socket messages to render the game, display, start, stop, select the game parameters, etc.
Due to privacy issues, I cannot include the graphics server written by the professor but the code I have written is fully functional and wel developed.
